# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-FNN
This project aims to implement a handwritten digit classification system using a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), and the task is to build a model that can accurately classify these digits.
